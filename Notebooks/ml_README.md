## Machine Learning Model Overview

The main model used for this project is in car_supervised_learning and uses the Balanced Random Forest Classifier. In order to take full advantage of the classifier, we processed the data in order to focus on how each make influences the target of price. That being said, we still used one model that included all the columns from our dataset, except the geopgraphical columns. After that we made a model that focuses only on the make, year, model, and trim. Following that we made two more models which seperate regular makes from luxury makes, as the luxury cars create some bias in the other model where they are together. We found the Balanced Random Forest Classifier to be better than the previous model used because it gives us a better idea on how each make influences price. Another model we used is a cluster model using pca. This was made to create visualiztions to better understand the dataset. The data was preprocessed the same away as the BRFC model and creates three models(all makes, regular, and luxury). 

## Results

The accuracy scores for the BRFC models is currently around .70 for all three, but this wasn't always the case. In order to get the balanced accuracy score to where it is now, it took some experimentation with the amount of features and sample size. Earlier in our analysis, the balanced accuracy score was in the range of .30-.60. This was due to the fact the sample size was too small. However, this led to an observation that seperates regular makes and luxury makes. When the sample size was smaller, the accuracy score of luxury makes was consistantly higher than the regular makes. This makes sense because used luxury makes are going to have a higher price than regular cars, regardless of mileage. When we increased the sample size, the luxury makes still had a higher accuracy score but there was less of a gap between the luxury accuracy score and regular accuracy score.
