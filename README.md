# Final_Project

## Purpose

### Overview

For this project we sought to answer the question of which brand of vehicle is the most cost-effective to buy in its used form. Usually this question would be defined by mileage and price only, but with this project we hope to discover which other categories might lend themselves to a used car's value.
