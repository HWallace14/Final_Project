# Final_Project

## Purpose

### Overview

For this project we sought to use machine learning to determine if there is a specific set of factors that determines a used vehicle's sale price.

## Initial Observations

Our first pass of the data found that there were two main types of used vehicles; luxury cars and everyday vehicles. We decided to separate the two because they were so different that they were acting as outliers to one another.
